# Technical-Analysis-in-R

In this Project, I used R to develop and test a Trading Strategy combining commonly known technical indicators - Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and Average Directional Index (ADX). I created my own conditions for trading which are detailed in the pdf report and tested the strategy against the Naive Filter and Buy and Hold strategies. My code to implement and test the strategy is in the .r file.
